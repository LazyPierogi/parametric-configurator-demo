# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute.

## Quick Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- Avoid committing secrets (API keys, tokens, `.env*`, private keys). Use environment variables and update `.env.example` if needed.
- Prefer small PRs with a clear problem statement and screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.

## Development

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the web app: `npm run dev`
- Run tests (if applicable): `npm test`

## Pull Requests

- Describe what changed and why.
- Include steps to verify (and any screenshots).
- If you touch configuration, document it in `README.md` and/or `docs/`.
