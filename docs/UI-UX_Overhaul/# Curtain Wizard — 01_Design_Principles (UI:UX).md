# Curtain Wizard — 01_Design_Principles.md  
*(UI/UX Guidelines – Section 1)*  

---

## TL;DR  
Curtain Wizard helps people imagine, design, and order curtains effortlessly — in minutes, not weeks.  
Our design philosophy is **Apple’s calm precision meets IKEA’s human warmth**: clear, tactile, and emotionally reassuring.  
Every pixel should say *“you’re in good hands — relax, we’ve got this.”*

## 1. Design Philosophy  

### 🧭 Simplicity First  
The product solves a complex process (measuring, selecting, ordering) through simplicity.  
We design so users **never feel the system’s complexity** — only its ease.  

> “Invisible intelligence, visible beauty.”

### ✨ Emotion & Trust  
Every screen should make users feel **confident and delighted**, not anxious.  
We achieve this through clarity, space, motion, and meaningful feedback — the UI should *breathe*.  

Moments of magic:
- When AI measurement finishes → soft confirmation ripple and calm haptic.  
- When curtains appear → smooth parallax fade-in like a daylight transition.  
- When summary completes → satisfying “completion” pulse (subtle, not gamified).  

### ⚖️ Function Meets Feeling  
Design balances **aesthetic restraint** with **human character**.  
Nothing should shout — but everything should *speak clearly*.  
Typography and spacing lead the eye gently; motion provides reassurance that “it’s working.”

## 2. Mobile-First DNA  

Curtain Wizard is conceived for **the hand, not the mouse**.  
Our mobile flow is **a vertical journey** — each step reveals the next, like unrolling fabric.

Principles:
- **Thumb-reachable zones** for all primary actions.  
- **Single main action per screen**; secondary options tucked behind drawers or modals.  
- **Progressive disclosure** — show what matters now, hide what’s next until needed.  
- **Fluid continuity**: transitions should feel as if the interface *slides over glass*, not page reloads.

💡 *Design Intent Note:*  
Desktop layouts reuse mobile logic — not the other way around. The desktop is a “wide mobile,” not a separate app.

## 3. Visual Hierarchy  

### Primary Hierarchy  
1. **User’s photo** – always the hero.  
2. **Curtain visualization** – layered on the photo, subtly dimensional.  
3. **Configurator panels** – translucent “liquid glass” surfaces hovering above.  
4. **CTAs and guidance** – minimal, contrast-driven, readable at a glance.

### Space & Light  
Use generous white-space and subtle shadows to simulate air and depth.  
Opacity levels guide focus (0.9 active / 0.7 background / 0.5 passive).

### Feedback & Flow  
Every user action triggers a gentle response:
- **Tap → ripple → visual confirmation.**  
- **Load → animated shimmer or fade-in.**  
- **Error → calm vibration, micro-shake, retry button appears instantly.**

## 4. Tone of Experience  

| Emotion | UI Treatment | Microcopy Voice |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Confidence | Stable alignment, consistent spacing, responsive speed | “Got it. Measuring your wall…” |
| Delight | Soft movement, color accent on confirm | “Nice choice — these will look amazing.” |
| Reassurance | Neutral backgrounds, visible progress, micro-feedback | “Almost done… just one more step.” |

Microcopy should be short, friendly, and human.  
Avoid robotic or salesy phrasing — we’re a helpful design assistant, not a chatbot or salesperson.  

---

## 5. Accessibility Philosophy (for future phase)  

Even though MVP deprioritizes full accessibility, we design **with empathy by default**:  
- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast where possible.  
- Tap areas ≥ 44 px.  
- Clear hierarchy between visual and text cues.  
- Animations that feel *natural*, never dizzying.

---

## 6. “Design Like Apple Would, Sell Like IKEA Would”  

Apple’s precision gives us trust.  
IKEA’s humanity gives us warmth.  
Curtain Wizard combines both through:
- **Clarity over clutter.**
- **Effortless progress** (less steps, more feedback).  
- **Playful yet premium visuals** (glass, light, motion).  
- **Human guidance tone** (we help, never command).

---

## 7. Design Mantra  

> **“One flow. One photo. One beautiful result.”**  

Every design decision should bring the user closer to this feeling:
> “It just worked — and it even looked good while doing it.”
